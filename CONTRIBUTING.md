All participants in this project are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it to understand the standards we expect and what to do if you encounter unacceptable behavior.

### How You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, including:

* **Code:** Implementing new features, fixing bugs, or improving the performance of the framework.
* **Documentation:** Writing tutorials, improving the API reference, or clarifying our guides.
* **Use Cases & Examples:** Adding new examples of how Symbiont can be used in different scientific domains.
* **Feedback & Ideas:** Participating in discussions and providing feedback on the project's direction.

#### Finding an Issue to Work On

The best place to start is our [Issues tab](https://github.com/dilee/symbiont-core/issues).

* Look for issues tagged with **`good first issue`**. These are tasks that we've identified as great entry points to the project.
* If you have a new idea, please open a new issue to discuss it before you start working on it. This helps us ensure your work aligns with the project's goals.

#### The Development Process

1.  **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/symbiont-core.git`
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4.  **Make your changes.** Write clean, well-commented code.
5.  **Add tests** for your changes in the `tests/` directory.
6.  **Ensure all tests pass** by running your test suite.
7.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message.
8.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
9.  **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to the `main` branch of the original Symbiont repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you've made.

### Project Roadmap

To help you see where the project is going and where your contributions can have the most impact, here is our high-level roadmap.

* **Phase 1: Core Framework & Toy Problem**
    * **Goal:** Build the foundational architecture and prove the concept.
    * **We Need Help With:** Developing the initial DSL parser, building a simple generative model for a toy problem (e.g., DNA sequences), and creating the first version of the Streamlit dashboard.

* **Phase 2: Integration & Alpha Release**
    * **Goal:** Integrate a real-world generative model and release to early adopters.
    * **We Need Help With:** Building a robust integration layer for a model like RFdiffusion, expanding the DSL with rules for protein engineering, and refining the dashboard with advanced visualizations.

* **Phase 3: Community & Expansion**
    * **Goal:** Foster a thriving community and expand the framework's capabilities.
    * **We Need Help With:** Developing documentation and tutorials, adding support for GNN-based molecule generation, and engaging with the scientific community.

### Who We're Looking For

We are building a cross-disciplinary team. If you have skills in any of the following areas, we would love your help:

* **AI & Machine Learning Developers:** Expertise in Python, PyTorch, and generative models.
* **Software Architects & Engineers:** Skills in API design, DSL development.
* **Frontend & UI/UX Designers:** Experience with Streamlit, Gradio, and data visualization.
* **Domain Scientists (Biologists, Chemists, etc.):** Your expertise is crucial for defining use cases and testing the framework.
* **Technical Writers & Community Managers:** Help us create clear documentation and build an active community.

Thank you again for your interest in Symbiont. We look forward to building the future of scientific discovery with you!
