## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Gradient instability**: Multiple t-norm options, extensive testing
- **Discrete bottleneck**: Multiple pathways (relaxation, decoding, hybrid)
- **Performance overhead**: Early optimization, GPU acceleration

### Adoption Risks
- **Complexity barrier**: Intuitive DSL, extensive examples
- **Integration friction**: Pre-built adapters, clear patterns
- **Trust/validation**: Rigorous benchmarks, domain pilots

## Resource Requirements

### Phase 1-2 (Critical Path)
- 1-2 senior engineers
- GPU compute for testing
- Domain expert consultation

### Phase 3-4 (Scaling)
- 3-4 engineers
- Computational biology/chemistry partners
- Cluster for large-scale experiments

## Decision Points

**After Phase 1**: Continue if gradient stability achieved and feasibility checking works

**After Phase 2**: Continue if real model integration shows >50% constraint satisfaction

**After Phase 3**: Scale up if domain pilot shows clear value over baselines

## Alternative Paths

If discrete generation proves intractable:
- Focus on continuous generators (VAEs, diffusion models)
- Position as specialized tool for those architectures
- Revisit discrete after field advances

If performance overhead too high:
- Pivot to training-time constraint integration
- Focus on fine-tuning with constraints
- Hybrid approach with lightweight inference guidance
